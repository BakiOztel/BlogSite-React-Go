I was asked to design a website for a graduation project . My teacher asked me to write the Api part in go language this time to adapt to different technologies. The project may have been simple, but in limited time, this is what I can do to learn and do.

### Technologies
- FrontEnd
    - [React](https://reactjs.org/)
    - [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
    - [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux-Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)
    - [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)

- BackEnd
    -[gofiber](https://docs.gofiber.io/)
    -[go-jwt](github.com/golang-jwt/jwt/v5)
    -[gorm](gorm.io/gorm)
    -[Mysql](https://www.mysql.com/)

### Weaknesses of the project
- MySQL was difficult to use as I am used to using mongodb. While writing data to the front end, data that should not be sent unnecessarily has been sent.

- Since I lack css in the design parts, when you download the page in scale, the objects I wrote without the help of the library are intertwined.
